# PlaylistManager
A project for my CS162 course at PCC.  Demonstrates various skills such as dynamic memory allocation, reading and writing files, recursion, and data structures (a doubly linked list, in this case).  

As an academic project, this respository contains code provided and required by the professor; including the specific identifiers of certain functions, and the bulk of the content contained in the header files for the 'list' and 'song' classes.
